- **Core Libraries:** `yt-dlp` (Downloader), `ffmpeg-python` (Conversion)
- **CLI Framework:** Typer + Rich
- **Data models:** Pydantic v2
- **Testing:** pytest, coverage
- **Build:** Poetry / pip

### 1.2 Architecture
```
src/yt2audi/
├── cli/           # CLI interface (Typer commands)
├── core/          # Business logic (Downloader, Converter, Splitter)
├── models/        # Data structures (Pydantic)
└── utils/         # Helpers (Path sanitization, Validation)
```

### 1.3 Key Features
- **Smart GPU Detection:** Auto-selects NVENC, AMF, or QuickSync.
- **Profile System:** Pre-tuned configs for Audi MMI (FAT32 splitting, exFAT quality).
- **Security:** Strict path sanitization and pinned dependencies.
- **Resilience:** Automatic retries and specific error handling.

## 3. Implementation Progress Report

**Last Updated Status:** Phase 4 Active

### Recent Accomplishments
1.  **Resolved Critical Bugs:**
    *   Fixed `yt2audi-interactive.bat` crashing due to directory/path issues.
    *   Resolved `UserWarning` regarding Typer/Click versions by updating `pyproject.toml`.
    *   **Fixed YouTube 403 Forbidden errors:** Updated `downloader.py` to use `android`/`ios` client simulation and force IPv4 (`source_address='0.0.0.0'`). Also unpinned `yt-dlp` to ensure latest extraction logic is always available.
    
2.  **GitHub Migration:**
    *   Cleaned repository history of large binaries (~4.5GB removed).
    *   Successfully uploaded project to GitHub (`origin/main`).
    *   Restored and pushed CI workflows.

### Metrics Snapshot
| Metric | Baseline | Current | Target |
|--------|----------|---------|--------|
| **Test Coverage** | ~65% | ~65% | 85% |
| **Security Score** | B | A | A+ |
| **Repo Size** | ~50MB | ~35MB | <50MB |
| **Dependencies** | Vulnerable | Secured | Pinned |

## 4. Technical Recommendations (from Analysis)

### Performance Optimizations (PERF)
- **Async Pipeline:** Move from sequential `for` loop to `asyncio.gather`. Use a semaphore to limit concurrency (e.g., 3 downloads) to avoid rate limits while maximizing bandwidth.
- **FFmpeg Flags:** Add `-movflags +faststart` and `-max_muxing_queue_size` for better stability on large files.

### Code Quality (CODE)
- **Type Safety:** Continue using `mypy --strict`.
- **Error Handling:** Ensure `DownloadError` wraps low-level exceptions with user-friendly messages (e.g., "Geo-blocked" instead of HTTP 403).

### Testing (TEST)
- **Integration Tests:** Needs end-to-end test of `Download -> Convert -> Split` on a real small file.
- **Mocking:** Mock `yt_dlp` responses to test edge cases without hitting YouTube (avoid bans during testing).

## Implementation Report: Phase 3 (Enhancements) 🚀
**Status: COMPLETED (2026-01-31)**

### 1. USB Automation & Transfer
- Implemented `USBManager` with native Windows drive detection.
- Integrated auto-copy logic into the processing pipeline.
- Added disk space verification and directory auto-creation.

### 2. Performance & Reliability
- **Resume Support**: Enabled `yt-dlp` fragment resume and native HLS downloader for long videos.
- **Metadata Caching**: Persistent JSON cache for video info to bypass redundant network calls.
- **Playlist Tracking**: Global `history.txt` to avoid re-processing previously finished videos.
- **Smart Cleanup**: Source videos are only deleted after 100% successful conversion.

### 3. API Documentation
- Set up Sphinx documentation engine with ReadTheDocs theme.
- Configured `autodoc` and `napoleon` for Google-style docstring parsing.
- Generated full API reference for the entire codebase.
